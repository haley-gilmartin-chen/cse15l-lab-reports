## Part 2 - Researching `grep`
---
`-c` (or --count): Outputs the count of matching lines in each file, rather than showing the lines themselves.

`-n` (or --line-number): Outputs line numbers along with lines.

`-H` (or --with-filename): Outputs the file name before each line.

`-q` (or --quiet or --silent): Suppress normal output. It's typically used when you want to check if a pattern exists without displaying the results.
